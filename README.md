# Time series analysis
Time series data are ubiquitous; some examples are 
- stock prices, 
- economic indicators (GDP, production, demand etc.)  
- physiological signals (time variation of heart rate variability, electrocardiogram, blood pressure)
- Speech

Basically, any variable that changes with time (or  for which order is important, to be abstract) is a time series.
Unlike cross-sectional data time-series analysis requires methods that take into account the past history 
and information that lead to the current state. This is essential to make a prediction or forecast.

The IPython notebooks here, present some time series analysis method applied on the US women employment data. 
## Goal
The goal is to walk through the steps required for a sound time series analysis.
It is meant to be pedagogical with many commentaries. Maths is kept at bare essentials. There are
various good references on this topic that cover various aspects of the subject in detail. 

## Methodology
The following steps are taken:
- Time series visualization
- Exploratory analysis
- Test of stationarity
- ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
- Exponential Smoothing
- Regression
- Neural Network

## References
I recommend the following references which are very practical and yet cover the mathematics:
